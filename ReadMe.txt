----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Piano-Pads is an interesting, addictive and educative piano learning game.
Its currently being built as a web application, after which the android and ios apps will be built.


Its very simple, just select your favourite music and press play.
To play your favourite music, you have to hit the pads on which the ball falls.

If you miss the ball for three(3) consecutive times, then your game is over... (lol, you don't know your song well)


At the end of the game, you view your total scores which is the number of times to capture the balls.

Future Development Includes:
	* AI capabilities to enable you add your own local songs. the Al will then convert the song into piano keys
	its a lot, i can't say it all, just wait for it.!!!!
